Gator is the next step in creating open-source hardware
compilation tools that are **correct** and **extensible**.

## What is Gator?

Getting hardware right is critical ‚Äì correct hardware is the mechanism that ultimately enables the
correctness of software. While formally verified hardware compilers exist, these compilers are
too brittle to keep up with the ever-changing landscape of FPGA hardware primitives.
As a result, mainstream FPGA compilers make no formal correctness guarantees about the designs
they synthesize, leaving hardware designers to simply hope what they get is correct. Shoot!

As a first step toward a more correct FPGA compiler, we propose Gator:
a technology mapper which leverages the extensibility properties of tools like
[Lakeroad](https://github.com/uwsampl/lakeroad)
to provide these critical correctness guarantees to the hardware designer.

See my [slides](https://ninehusky.github.io/assets/02-14-2024-gator-talk.pdf)
for a high-level overview of the project.

## More
You'll need to set `$GATOR_DIR` to this. You can do this by running `export GATOR_DIR=$(pwd)` in the root directory of this repository.

Gator is an offshoot project of the [Lakeroad](https://github.com/uwsampl/lakeroad) project
-- none of this would be possible without the hard work of my fellow Lakeroad teammates!
